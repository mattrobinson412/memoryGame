# memoryGameProject
Memory Game Project for Springboard curriculum (4.5).
In this project, I used a starter code for the HTML, CSS, and JS, and then I built on top of it to create the style, extra buttons, and overall function of the game. Let me know if there are any revisions that you think might be necessary/helpful!
